**Caution** : This [SVG file](https://github.com/execuc/ble-arcade-stick/blob/master/cad/arcade-tol0_8-slot1_placed.svg) has not been still cut so I do not know if he has designs errors.

It was made with [LCInterlocking](https://github.com/execuc/LCInterlocking) FreeCAD module. It allow to design parts in 3D with 
interlocking. Then parts are projected on plane in order to export in SVG file.

The stick is designed to use cheap buttons and stick kits. There 6 30mm buttons 2 24mm buttons, 20mm hole for power switch.
It uses mainly T-Slot with M4*20mm.


LCInterlocking parameters are :
 * Laser kerf : 0.29mm
 * Thickness tolerance : 0,8mm => 0.2mm (6mm MDF thickness tolerance) + 0.6
 * Slot witdh tolerance : 1mm
 

There are three files :
 * arcade_stick.fcstd : FreeCAD without interlocking.
 * arcade_stick_join.fcstd : FreeCAD with interlocking.
 * arcade-tol0_8-slot1_placed.svg : file to laser cut.
